It is a workaround until conclusion of https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17718, we can create manual jobs that would be started by this python work.

Its proposal is to execute manual jobs inside Gitlab group or project, so you can queue a manual job that will be started in a proper time by this program.
